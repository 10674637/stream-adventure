Convert data from `process.stdin` to upper-case data on `process.stdout`
using the `through2` module.

through(write, end) returns a readable/writable stream and given `write` and
`end` functions, both of which are optional.

When you call `src.pipe(dst)` on some stream `dst` created with `through()`, the
`write(buf)` function will be called when data from `src` is available.
When `src` is done sending data, the `end()` function is called.

Inside the `write` and `end` callbacks, `this` is set to the through stream
returned by `through()` so you can just call `this.push()` inside the callbacks
to transform data.

When you specify a falsy value for the `write` argument, this function is used
to pass input data directly through to the output unmodified:

    function write (buf, encoding, next) {
        this.push(buf);
        next();
    }
 
The default `end` function is just:

    function end (done) { done(); }

For example, here is a program that fires the `write(buf)` and `end()` callbacks
by calling `.write()` and `.end()` manually:

    var through = require('through2');
    var tr = through(write, end);
    tr.write('beep\n');
    tr.write('boop\n');
    tr.end();
    
    function write (buf, _, next) { console.dir(buf); next();}
    function end (done) { console.log('__END__'); next();}

Instead of calling `console.dir(buf)`, your code should use `this.push()` in
your `write()` function to output upper-cased data.

Don't forget to feed data into your stream from stdin and output data from
stdout, which should look something like:

    process.stdin.pipe(tr).pipe(process.stdout);

Note that the chunks you will get from `process.stdin` are Buffers, not strings.
You can call `buf.toString()` on a Buffer to get a string and strings can do
`.toUpperCase()`.

Make sure to `npm install through` in the directory where your solution
file lives.
